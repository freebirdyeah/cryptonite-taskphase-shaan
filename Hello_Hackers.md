# Hello Hackers

Module Description: Covers the basics of command line on how to execute commands along with arguments

## Intro to Commands

> Challenge Statement: In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: hello is different from HELLO.

Simply invoke the `hello` command to get the flag `pwn.college{UfAWZjq_noMvGG0m_mYZyqZdIAl.ddjNyUDL2MDO0czW}`

## Intro to Arguments

> Challenge Statement: In this challenge, to get the flag, you must run the hello command with a single argument of hackers. Try it now!

Arguments seem to follow commands and tell the command what to do. 

Here, simply invoke the `hello` command with the argument `hackers` like: `$ hello hackers` to obtain the flag `pwn.college{kIuJJRI3mApKGuaSlis-JnQ63jG.dhjNyUDL2MDO0czW}`
